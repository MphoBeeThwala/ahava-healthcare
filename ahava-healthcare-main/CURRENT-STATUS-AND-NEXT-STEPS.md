Current status and next steps

Last updated 9 October 2025. The platform stands roughly ninety-five percent ready for testing: the backend exposes more than forty endpoints; four Next.js applications cover admin, doctor, patient, and nurse roles; sixteen security features, Paystack payments, WebSocket messaging, file uploads, BullMQ workers, and Prisma migrations are complete; documentation exceeds fifteen thousand lines. Dependencies are installed across backend (612 packages) and frontend apps (roughly 301 shared modules) under Node.js 22.20.0 and npm 10.9.3. Configuration files are in place with secure JWT and encryption keys, frontend `.env.local` files, and helper scripts such as `docker-compose.yml`, `SETUP-CLOUD-DB.md`, `QUICK-START-CLOUD.ps1`, `START-DEVELOPMENT.ps1`, and the seeding routine.

Before launching locally, provision PostgreSQL and Redis. Supabase (recommended) delivers a managed PostgreSQL connection in minutes: create the `ahava-healthcare` project, choose a strong password, copy the pooling URI, and record it. Upstash offers Redis with similar speed; create a regional database and copy the Redis URL. Paste those values into `apps/backend/.env`, replacing `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL`, run the Prisma commands (`npx prisma generate`, `npx prisma migrate deploy`, `npm run prisma:seed`), and confirm the seed output lists the admin, doctor, nurse, and patient accounts. From the repository root, run `.\START-DEVELOPMENT.ps1` to launch the backend, workers, and all four portals; then hit http://localhost:4000/health and the portals on ports 3000–3003, signing in with `Test@123456789`.

The wider roadmap remains intact. Week one focuses on local services (you are here: configure databases, run migrations, finish manual smoke tests). Week two brings external services (Paystack, email, Expo push) and validation. Weeks three and four cover security, performance, UAT, and documentation clean-up. Weeks five and six deliver staging deployments and monitoring. Weeks seven and eight move through compliance (POPIA, legal documents, insurance, verification). Weeks nine and ten run beta onboarding and feedback. Weeks eleven and twelve push production: security audit, production databases, DNS/SSL, monitoring, support, and launch marketing.

Costs stay near zero during development (Supabase, Upstash, SendGrid, Expo free tiers). Staging runs ~$20–$40 monthly (Railway plus optional monitoring). Production starts around $110–$195 monthly, plus one-time business, legal, and insurance outlays ($1.5–4k). Track pre-launch metrics such as endpoint coverage, login success, payments, messaging, background jobs, and bug counts; after launch focus on registrations, provider activity, completed bookings, payment success rate, latency, errors, and satisfaction scores.

Troubleshooting reminders: use `npx prisma db pull` if the backend fails to start, reset migrations with `npx prisma migrate reset`, check `npm list next react` if frontends refuse to compile, and kill conflicting processes with `Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 4000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process`. Key references include `GET-STARTED.md`, `SETUP-CLOUD-DB.md`, `INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md`, `TESTING-CHECKLIST.md`, `DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md`, `ULTIMATE-PROJECT-SUMMARY.md`, and `PROJECT-STATUS.md`.

In short, code, dependencies, configuration, scripts, and guides are ready. Provision Supabase and Upstash, update the `.env`, run migrations, start services, and you will have the entire platform—bookings, visits, payments, messaging—running locally within twenty minutes. Momentum continues by following `GET-STARTED.md` and advancing through the staged rollout plan.
