Changelog summary for Ahava Healthcare

Version 1.0.1 (29 September 2024) captured the final polish on the local development environment. The team configured Node.js 20.19.5, enabled Yarn 4.3.1 workspaces, and stood up PostgreSQL 15.14 alongside Redis 7.0.15. The `ahava-healthcare` database was provisioned with proper user permissions, environment variables were populated in `.env`, and secure JWT secrets plus encryption keys were generated. With dependencies installed and services reachable at `postgresql://ahava_user:ahava_dev_password@localhost:5432/ahava-healthcare` and `redis://localhost:6379`, the environment came online in the Africa/Johannesburg timezone.

Version 1.0.0 (29 September 2024) marked the rename from “kykthuto” to “Ahava Healthcare”, including updated package scopes (`@ahava-healthcare/*`), adjusted deployment configs, and refreshed documentation. This release introduced the full platform: Express.js and Prisma powered APIs, a healthcare-aware database schema, authentication with JWT refresh tokens, and features covering patient bookings, nurse visit management, doctor oversight, and administrative analytics. Real-time messaging, Paystack payments, PDF reporting, GPS tracking, and multilingual support rounded out the functional scope.

The technology stack spans Node.js, Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL with Prisma, Redis and BullMQ, WebSockets, Paystack integration, Sharp, and PDFKit. Infrastructure relies on managed PostgreSQL and Redis, local volume-backed storage for generated PDFs, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and Railway as the primary deployment target with Render and Fly.io as alternatives. Development practices include Yarn workspaces, strict TypeScript, Jest with Supertest, ESLint, and Prettier. Sensitive data remains encrypted and environment specific, aligned with Africa/Johannesburg operations.
