CI/CD status for Ahava Healthcare

The GitHub Actions pipelines now handle both continuous integration and deployment automatically. The testing workflow lives in `.github/workflows/test.yml`, runs on every push and pull request, installs Node.js 20 with Yarn 4.3.1, boots PostgreSQL 15 and Redis 7, applies migrations, executes 179 backend tests (26 utilities, 127 API mocks, 26 integration), performs a TypeScript build, and can upload the resulting 27.9 percent coverage numbers to Codecov. Environment variables within the workflow set `NODE_ENV=test`, point `DATABASE_URL` to `postgresql://ahava_user:ahava_test_password@localhost:5432/ahava-healthcare-test`, use `redis://localhost:6379/1`, and supply a dedicated JWT secret, encryption key, and `RATE_LIMIT_SKIP=true` so the suite runs quickly.

Deployment automation lives in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Whenever `main` receives a push (or the workflow is dispatched manually), GitHub Actions builds Docker images, pushes them to the GitHub Container Registry, and triggers deployments to Railway as the primary host with Render and Fly.io as fallbacks. Adding provider tokens (`RAILWAY_TOKEN`, `RENDER_API_KEY`, `FLY_API_TOKEN`) to repository secrets keeps everything authenticated.

Developer workflow remains straightforward: make a change, optionally run `yarn test` under `apps/backend`, commit, and push. GitHub Actions detects the push, sets up the toolchain, brings up services, runs migrations, executes tests, records coverage, and—if the commit targets `main`—rolls out the latest build. Results appear in the Actions tab (`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ahava-healthcare/actions`) with pass/fail badges that can be embedded in the README. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with the project owner to wire up the status badges.

Optional enhancements include enabling Codecov via a `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret, wiring in Slack or Discord webhooks for failure notifications, and expanding the deployment workflow with additional providers. The entire pipeline completes in about six minutes, so keeping local test runs fast and committing frequently maintains momentum. Best practices remain simple: run tests locally before pushing, treat failing workflows as blockers, keep secrets rotated, and confirm deployments in staging before promoting to production.
