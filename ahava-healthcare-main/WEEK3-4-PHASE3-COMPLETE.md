## 🎓 Technical Highlights

### 1. Messaging Architecture
```
Client → API → Encrypt → Database
       ↓
    WebSocket → Real-time delivery
       ↓
    Decrypt → Client
```

### 2. File Upload Flow
```
Client → API → Validate → Store
       ↓
   Generate unique filename
       ↓
   Return URL → Client
```

### 3. Background Job Flow
```
API → Add to Queue → Redis
