## 📈 RECOMMENDED TESTING STRATEGY

### Phase 1: API Endpoint Tests (Recommended Next - 2-3 days)

#### What to Test:
1. **Authentication Endpoints** (`/api/auth/*`)
   - Registration with valid/invalid data
   - Login with correct/wrong credentials
   - Token refresh flow
   - Logout functionality
   - CSRF token generation

2. **User Management** (`/api/admin/users/*`)
   - Create user (admin only)
   - List users with pagination
   - Update user
   - Deactivate user
   - Role-based access control

3. **Booking Endpoints** (`/api/bookings/*`)
   - Create booking
   - List bookings (filtered by user)
   - Get booking details
   - Update booking
   - Cancel booking

4. **Visit Endpoints** (`/api/visits/*`)
   - List visits
   - Get visit details
   - Update visit status
   - Add nurse report
   - Add doctor review
   - Assign nurse (admin only)

5. **Payment Endpoints** (`/api/payments/*`)
   - Initialize payment
   - Verify payment
   - List payments
   - Payment webhooks

6. **Messaging Endpoints** (`/api/messages/*`)
   - Send message
   - Get conversation
   - Mark as read
   - File attachments

**Estimated Tests**: ~80-100 tests  
**Time**: 2-3 days  
**Coverage Increase**: 40% → 70%

---

### Phase 2: Database Tests (2 days)

#### What to Test:
1. **Prisma Models**
   - User CRUD operations
   - Booking lifecycle
   - Visit state transitions
   - Payment records
   - Message storage

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Foreign key constraints
   - Required fields
   - Unique constraints
   - Default values
   - Cascading deletes

3. **Data Encryption**

   - Decryption works properly
   - Address encryption
   - ID number encryption
   - Medical report encryption

4. **Transactions**
   - Payment atomicity
   - Booking creation with payment
   - Visit creation from booking

**Estimated Tests**: ~40-50 tests  
**Time**: 1-2 days  
**Coverage Increase**: 70% → 85%

---

### Phase 3: Integration Tests (2-3 days)

#### What to Test:
1. **Complete User Flows**
   - Patient registration → Booking → Payment
   - Nurse assignment → Visit completion → Report
   - Doctor review → Payment processing

   - Push notifications

**Estimated Tests**: ~30-40 tests  
**Time**: 2-3 days  
**Coverage Increase**: 85% → 95%

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Step 1: Prepare Test Environment (30 minutes)

1. **Create Test Database**
```powershell
cd ahava-healthcare-main/apps/backend

# Update .env to add test database URL
# DATABASE_URL_TEST="postgresql://ahava_user:ahava_dev_password@localhost:5432/ahava-healthcare-test"
```

2. **Install Additional Testing Tools**
```powershell
npm install --save-dev @faker-js/faker nock
```

3. **Create Test Utilities Directory**
```powershell
mkdir src/__tests__/utils
mkdir src/__tests__/api
mkdir src/__tests__/database
```

---

### Step 2: Write API Endpoint Tests (Today - Next 3 hours)

#### Priority 1: Authentication Tests (Highest Priority)
Create `src/__tests__/api/auth.test.ts`:
- Registration endpoint
- Login endpoint
- Token refresh
- Logout
- Password validation
- Account lockout

**Why First?** Everything else depends on authentication working.

#### Priority 2: Admin User Management Tests
Create `src/__tests__/api/admin.test.ts`:
- Create user (with RBAC testing)
- List users
- Deactivate users
- Statistics endpoints

**Why Second?** Tests role-based access control thoroughly.

#### Priority 3: Booking Flow Tests
Create `src/__tests__/api/bookings.test.ts`:
- Create booking as patient
- View own bookings
- Admin can view all bookings
- Cancel booking

**Why Third?** Core business functionality.

---

### Step 3: Database Tests (Tomorrow - 4 hours)

Create `src/__tests__/database/models.test.ts`:
- User model tests
- Booking model tests
- Visit model tests
- Payment model tests
- Message model tests
- Relationship tests

Create `src/__tests__/database/encryption.test.ts`:
- Test encrypted field storage
- Test decryption
- Test data integrity

---

### Step 4: Integration Tests (Day 3 - 4 hours)

Create `src/__tests__/integration/complete-flow.test.ts`:
- Full patient journey
- Full nurse journey
- Full doctor journey
- Payment processing end-to-end

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Minimum Viable Testing (Must Have)
- ✅ Unit tests for utilities (DONE - 26 tests)
- ⏳ API endpoint tests for all routes (TARGET - 100 tests)
- ⏳ Database integration tests (TARGET - 50 tests)
- ⏳ Critical user flows tested (TARGET - 40 tests)

### Ideal Testing (Should Have)
- ⏳ 80%+ code coverage
- ⏳ All security features tested
- ⏳ Load testing (100+ concurrent users)
- ⏳ CI/CD integration

### Optional (Nice to Have)
- ⏳ E2E tests with frontend
- ⏳ Performance benchmarks
- ⏳ Chaos engineering tests

---

## 💡 TESTING BEST PRACTICES TO FOLLOW

### 1. Test Structure (AAA Pattern)
```typescript
test('should create booking as patient', async () => {
  // Arrange - Set up test data
  const user = await createTestUser('PATIENT');
  const token = generateToken(user);
  
  // Act - Perform the action
  const response = await request(app)
    .post('/api/bookings')
    .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
    .send(bookingData);
  
  // Assert - Verify results
  expect(response.status).toBe(201);
  expect(response.body.booking).toBeDefined();
});
```

### 2. Database Cleanup
```typescript
beforeEach(async () => {
  // Clean database before each test
  await prisma.booking.deleteMany();
  await prisma.user.deleteMany();
});

afterAll(async () => {
  await prisma.$disconnect();
});
```

### 3. Test Isolation
- Each test should be independent
- No test should depend on another
- Use beforeEach/afterEach for cleanup

### 4. Meaningful Test Names
```typescript
// ❌ Bad
test('test 1', () => {});

// ✅ Good
test('should return 403 when non-admin tries to access admin route', () => {});
```

## 🚀 LET'S START!

**I recommend we begin with Option A: Authentication API Tests**

This gives us:
1. Foundation for all other tests (auth required)
2. Security validation (critical for healthcare)
3. Quick wins (authentication is well-defined)
4. Learning template for other endpoint tests

**Shall I proceed with creating comprehensive authentication API tests?**
