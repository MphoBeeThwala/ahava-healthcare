CI/CD verification summary

The GitHub Actions automation is live and verified. The `test.yml` workflow runs on every push or pull request against master, main, or develop. It installs Node.js 20 with Yarn 4.3.1, starts PostgreSQL 15 and Redis 7 services, applies Prisma migrations, executes all 179 backend tests (26 utilities, 127 API mocks, 26 integration), checks TypeScript builds, and emits a 27.9 percent coverage report. The complementary `deploy.yml` workflow remains in place to build Docker images, publish them to GitHub Container Registry, and deploy to Railway with Render and Fly.io as secondary targets once provider tokens are in repository secrets. Documentation sits alongside the workflows inside `.github/workflows/README.md`, with the setup and verification notes kept in the repository root.

Initial verification steps included confirming the presence of `.github/workflows/test.yml`, `.github/workflows/README.md`, and updated CI documentation, pushing the configuration to GitHub, and observing the “Test Suite” run under Actions. A passing run shows green checkmarks for the `test-backend`, `lint-backend`, and `test-results-summary` jobs, takes roughly three to five minutes, and reports the expected coverage. The Actions dashboard is available at `https://github.com/MphoBeeThwala/ahava-healthcare/actions`; individual workflow details appear under `…/actions/workflows/test.yml`. Status badges can be embedded in the README via `![Tests](https://github.com/MphoBeeThwala/ahava-healthcare/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)`.

With the pipeline active, each push triggers dependency installation, service startup, migration execution, test runs, and coverage publication. Notifications arrive through GitHub’s interface (and optional email), and pull requests gain automated checks. Optional next steps include connecting Codecov by adding a `CODECOV_TOKEN`, supplying deployment tokens for Railway, Render, and Fly.io, and wiring Slack or Discord webhooks for failure alerts. Manual verification can be repeated by making a small change, committing, pushing, and watching the workflow fire within seconds.

Troubleshooting focuses on ensuring workflows exist, Actions remain enabled in repository settings, branch names match triggers, and YAML syntax is valid. Test failures surface in the workflow logs; database issues usually trace back to service configuration or environment variables; dependency failures often point to Yarn version or lockfile inconsistencies. Supporting references include `.github/workflows/test.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, the workflow README, the CI/CD setup summary, and the broader testing documents.

Overall status: CI/CD is active, 179 tests pass with 27.9 percent coverage, and the automation provides quality gates on every push. Staging deployment can proceed once provider tokens are furnished, and future sprints can expand coverage, add frontend and end-to-end tests, and enhance reporting. Verification recorded by Mpho Thwala on behalf of Ahava on 88 Company.
