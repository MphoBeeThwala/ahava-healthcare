Deployment roadmap for Ahava Healthcare

Current status: code complete, tests passing at ninety nine point four percent, ready for deployment. Last updated November 6, 2025.

Phase 1: Local development setup (start here). Step 1 is to configure the development environment, which should take about thirty minutes. Install PostgreSQL and Redis—either via Docker (`docker-compose up -d`, verify with `docker ps`) or manually by installing PostgreSQL 15+ and Redis 7+. Once services are ready, switch into `ahava-healthcare-main/apps/backend`, copy `env.example` to `.env`, and populate local connection details (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, JWT_SECRET, ENCRYPTION_KEY, ENCRYPTION_IV_SALT, PORT=4000, NODE_ENV=development). Suggested local entries include `postgresql://ahava_user:ahava_dev_password@localhost:5432/ahava-healthcare` for the database and `redis://localhost:6379` for Redis.

Next, set up Prisma: run `yarn prisma:generate`, `yarn prisma:migrate`, and `yarn prisma:seed` from the backend directory. Start each service in its own terminal (`apps/backend` → `yarn dev`, `apps/admin` → `yarn dev`, `apps/doctor` → `yarn dev`, `apps/patient` → `yarn start`, `apps/nurse` → `yarn start`, and optionally backend workers via `yarn dev:worker`). Expected URLs: backend on http://localhost:4000, admin at http://localhost:3000, doctor at 3001, patient at 3002, nurse at 3003. Verify everything by hitting the health endpoint (`curl http://localhost:4000/health`), running `yarn test` in the backend, and logging into each portal. Phase 1 completes once services launch without errors, migrations succeed, test users are present, logins work, and local tests pass.

Phase 2: Staging deployment. Choose a hosting platform: Railway (recommended for MVP due to free tier, auto deploys, built-in databases), Render (good alternative with free frontend tier), or Fly.io (best latency for South Africa but more complex). For Railway: create an account, connect the repository, and add PostgreSQL and Redis services. Railway will supply `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL`. Deploy the backend by selecting `apps/backend` as root, letting Railway detect Node.js, and adding the necessary environment variables (JWT_SECRET, encryption keys, PORT=4000, NODE_ENV=production, Paystack keys, SMTP credentials, optional OpenAI key). Run migrations via Railway CLI or a deploy command (`railway run yarn prisma migrate deploy`, `railway run yarn prisma:seed`). For each frontend (admin, doctor, patient, nurse), create a separate Railway service pointing to the respective `apps/[name]` folder and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the backend’s staging URL. Phase 2 is done when the backend and frontends are live, migrations have run, and staging logins work for all roles.

Phase 3: Production deployment. Before launching, harden security by generating strong secrets (`node -e
