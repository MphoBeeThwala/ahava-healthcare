Frontend assessment report

Date: October 15, 2024. Assessment performed by the internal engineering team. Overall readiness is roughly 95 percent; the four portals are implemented with a modern stack and only require modest refinements—primarily shifting authentication to rely solely on httpOnly cookies and completing environment configuration.

Applications identified: the admin portal (`apps/admin`) runs on port 3000 and ships with login, dashboard, users, visits, and payments screens. The patient app (`apps/patient`) runs on port 3002 with login, dashboard, booking, and visit history. The nurse app (`apps/nurse`) runs on port 3003 with login, dashboard, visit detail, and visit report flows. The doctor app (`apps/doctor`) runs on port 3001 with login, dashboard, and visit review. All four portals use Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Axios, React Hook Form, Zod, Sonner, Lucide, and date-fns. Every portal already includes an API client with `withCredentials: true`, request/response interceptors, token refresh logic, and wrappers for auth, users, visits, payments, bookings, and messages. Zustand stores manage auth state with login/logout helpers, session checks, and loading flags. UI components deliver responsive layouts, form validation, toast-based error handling, and clean styling.

Primary updates required: remove localStorage usage from the API client and auth store across all portals so authentication relies exclusively on httpOnly cookies. The backend already issues the cookies, so removing `localStorage.getItem`, `setItem`, and `removeItem` calls is the only change. Estimated time is about one hour for all four apps. Environment configuration is also outstanding: each app needs a `.env.local` containing `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:4000`, with the patient app also including `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY`. Expect fifteen minutes to create the files. Dependencies should be installed (`npm install` in each app), which will take roughly ten minutes total. Finally, confirm Tailwind color tokens (`primary-*`) exist or swap them for standard Tailwind palette entries—a low-priority item worth roughly thirty minutes.

Compatibility with the backend is excellent: cookie-based auth aligns with the API client, JWT refresh flows already exist, role-based logic is ready, and all endpoints are mapped. Messaging, payments, and visit endpoints are fully wired; only file upload UI and WebSocket connections remain on the backlog. The quick wins involve authentication, environment setup, dependency installation, and startup verification. After those, the team should walk through admin user management, patient bookings, nurse visit updates, and doctor review flows to ensure end-to-end coverage. Advanced follow-up tasks include WebSocket integration for live messaging, file upload components, and Paystack payment UI.

Suggested timeline: two hours to complete the critical updates (authentication cleanup, environment files, installs, startup testing). Roughly eight hours to connect each portal’s core features (two hours per portal). Ten additional hours cover advanced work such as sockets, uploads, and payment UI, bringing the total to about twenty hours across a couple of days. Status remains positive—the frontend is well structured, modern, and synchronized with the backend contracts. Proceed with finishing the authentication change, create the environment files, install dependencies, test logins against the backend, and then continue with feature integration.
