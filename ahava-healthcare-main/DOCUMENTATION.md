Project documentation overview

This note serves as the front door for Ahava Healthcare documentation. When you need the big picture, open `README.md` for the story of the platform and deployment flow, then dip into `COMPLETE-PLATFORM-DESCRIPTION.md` for the detailed journeys across the patient, nurse, doctor, and admin experiences.

For onboarding, follow `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` to prepare the local environment, pair it with `INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` for the full setup script, and keep `workspace/README.md` close by for monorepo commands and conventions.

Each application keeps its own field guide. Look at `apps/admin/README.md`, `apps/doctor/README.md`, `apps/nurse/README.md`, and `apps/patient/README.md` for run commands and local tips, while `deploy/README.md` captures configuration choices when we promote builds.

Operational references live in `FULL-PLATFORM-TEST-PLAN.md`, `MANUAL-TEST-STEPS.md`, `CURRENT-BUILD-STATUS.md`, and `GO-LIVE-CHECKLIST.md`. These outline how we validate releases, track readiness, and cover security guidelines noted in `docs/SECURITY.md`.

History and feature notes are gathered in `COMPLETE-FEATURE-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`, `WEEK1-2-SECURITY-FIXES.md`, `WEEK3-4-COMPLETE-REPORT.md`, `PROJECT-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md`, and `TEST-FIXES-SUMMARY.md`. Quick wins, smoke tests, and planning threads appear in `QUICK-TESTING-GUIDE.md`, `DOCTOR-ENHANCEMENT-PLAN.md`, and the related roadmap files.

Update this index whenever new material arrives so the next teammate knows exactly where to land.
