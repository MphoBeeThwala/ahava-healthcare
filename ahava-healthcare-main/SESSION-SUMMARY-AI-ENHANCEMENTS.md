Session summary: AI enhancements roadmap

We met to map the next wave of AI-assisted diagnosis improvements while keeping clinical safety and compliance in view. During the conversation we confirmed that `apps/backend/src/services/ai-diagnosis.ts` and its companion routes are production ready, and we walked through the doctor, nurse, and patient interfaces to make sure the AI results appear with the right permissions and disclaimers. We also agreed on the priorities that will improve reliability, manage cost, and reveal how the triage service behaves in the field.

Key outcomes included a full review of the analysis pipeline—from emergency detection to wearable processing and fallback logic—verification that override workflows capture doctor rationale for audit trails, and updates to the summary documents (`AI-ENHANCEMENTS-IMPLEMENTED.md` and `AI-ENHANCEMENT-PROMPTS.md`) so they reflect the current state.

Action items coming out of the session are to expand reporting on AI recommendation accuracy, override frequency, and turnaround time, draft medical review guidelines for clinicians who consume AI insights, and finish the rollout plan for sandbox mode, multilingual support, and coaching overlays.

Reference material for follow-up work lives in `AI-ENHANCEMENT-PROMPTS.md`, `AI-ENHANCEMENTS-IMPLEMENTED.md`, `COMPLETE-PLATFORM-DESCRIPTION.md`, and `CURRENT-BUILD-STATUS.md`. We will regroup after the next sprint to review progress and adjust priorities as needed.
