**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Sprint**: Week 1-2 Security Hardening  
**Status**: **READY FOR REVIEW & TESTING**

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### ✅ CRITICAL FIXES (100% Complete)

1. **Encryption Vulnerability** - Fixed deprecated crypto functions
   - Replaced `createCipher` with `createCipheriv` 
   - Implemented AES-256-GCM with authentication tags
   - Random IV for each encryption operation

### ✅ HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (100% Complete)

2. **Role-Based Access Control** - Admin routes now properly protected
   - Added `requireAdmin` middleware
   - Role-specific data filtering
   - Soft delete for user accounts

3. **Password Security** - Strengthened password requirements
   - Minimum 12 characters (was 8)
   - Must include: uppercase, lowercase, number, special char
   - Clear validation messages

4. **Input Validation** - All routes now validated
   - Joi schemas for admin & payment routes
   - Phone number validation (+27XXXXXXXXX)
   - Amount limits and field validation

### ✅ MEDIUM PRIORITY FIXES (100% Complete)

5. **Account Lockout** - Brute force protection
   - 5 failed attempts = 30-minute lockout
   - Email-based tracking
   - Clear lockout messages

6. **Enhanced Rate Limiting** - Granular protection
   - Registration: 3/hour per IP
   - Login: 5/15min per IP (failed only)
   - API: 100/15min per IP
   - Webhooks: 50/min per IP

7. **CSRF Protection** - Cross-site attack prevention
   - Token generation & validation
   - 1-hour token expiration
   - Conditional for API tokens

8. **Structured Logging** - Professional logging system
   - File-based with daily rotation
   - 5 log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, SECURITY)
   - JSON format for parsing

9. **Error Handling** - Prevented information leakage
   - Sanitized error messages in production
   - Internal detailed logging
   - Proper HTTP status codes

---

## ⏳ Remaining Tasks (Week 3)

10. **Secure Token Storage** (Frontend) - 2-4 hours
    - Replace localStorage with httpOnly cookies
    - Add secure & SameSite flags

11. **WebSocket Security** (Backend Enhancement) - 3-4 hours
    - Move auth to handshake headers
    - Add WebSocket rate limiting

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before proceeding to Week 3-4:

### Required Tests
- [ ] Admin routes deny non-admin users
- [ ] Weak passwords are rejected
- [ ] Account locks after 5 failed logins
- [ ] CSRF protection blocks requests without token
- [ ] Rate limits work correctly
- [ ] Encrypted data stores and retrieves correctly
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Logs write to files correctly

### Commands to Run
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
cd ahava-healthcare-main/apps/backend
npm run type-check

# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

# Start server and test
npm run dev

# Test registration with weak password
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "password": "weak",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "role": "PATIENT"
  }'

# Should return password validation error
```

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

### ✅ Ready
- Encryption fixed
- RBAC implemented
- Input validation complete
- Logging system operational
- Error handling improved

### ⚠️ Before Production
1. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   JWT_SECRET=<strong-32-char-secret>
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=<base64-32-byte-key>
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. Configure infrastructure:
   - Enable HTTPS
   - Set up log rotation
   - Configure Redis for sessions
   - Set up monitoring

3. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run prisma:migrate
   ```
